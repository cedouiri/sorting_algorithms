# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
*  ### Definition

**Sorting algorithm**

sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list in a certain order.

**Big O**

big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their running time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.

* ### Types of Sorting

**Bubble sort algorithm**

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexity are of Ο(n2) where **n** is the number of items.

**Insertion Sort Algorithm**

Insertion sort is the sorting mechanism where the sorted array is built having one item at a time. The array elements are compared with each other sequentially and then arranged simultaneously in some particular order. The analogy can be understood from the style we arrange a deck of cards. This sort works on the principle of inserting an element at a particular position, hence the name Insertion Sort.

**Selection sort algorithm**

Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is an in-place comparison-based algorithm in which the list is divided into two parts, the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end. Initially, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part is the entire list.

The smallest element is selected from the unsorted array and swapped with the leftmost element, and that element becomes a part of the sorted array. This process continues moving unsorted array boundary by one element to the right.

This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexities are of Ο(n2), where  **n**  is the number of items.

**# Quick Sort Algorithm**

QuickSort is one of the most efficient sorting algorithms and is based on the splitting of an array into smaller ones. The name comes from the fact that, quick sort is capable of sorting a list of data elements significantly faster than any of the common sorting algorithms.
